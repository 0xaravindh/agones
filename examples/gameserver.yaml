# Full example of a single Game Server resource
#
# This is a superset of the PodSpec (https://kubernetes.io/docs/api-reference/v1.8/#podspec-v1-core)
# that sets hostNetwork=true, provides the port to open on as KOOLIE_GAMESERVER_PORT environment variable
# and provides a sidecar for this game server that the SDK will connect with.
#
# By default, RestartPolicy is set to "Never", but can be overwritten.
